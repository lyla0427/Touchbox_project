<h2><u>Mission Statement</u></h2>
<p>This project is aimed to provide Chelsea players’ touch area map and the relationship between their game performance (rating) and percentage/degree of their touch in the specific area since Thomas Tuchel became the manager of Chelsea FC</p>
<br>

<h2><u>Data Collection Method</u></h2>
<p>1. Divided the field into 22 areas</p>
<small> - Based on the different grid colors of the soccer field, which was divided either in rectangles or squares, the field was divided into 22 areas</small>
<br>
<small> - The areas were not fixed throughout the whole game. Instead, the areas followed the attacking direction, meaning that the place on the field where area indicates flipped after the first half.</small>
<p>2. Re-watched all Premier League and UEFA Champions League since Thomas Tuchel became the manager (2020/2021 PL R20 Wolverhampton ~ 2021/2022 entire season)</p>
<p>3. While re-watching, recorded which player touched the ball in what area (Categorical: players’ initial / Numerical: area number)</p>
<p>4. Transferred the gathered data to Google Spreadsheet to make the data as a format that can be implemented into coding</p>
<br>

<h2><u>Rating Method</u></h2>
<p>The FotMob player rating is calculated based on more than 300 individual stats per player per match from Opta. A match in the per match ratings is any match the participant has been involved in even if he came on as substitute in the last few minutes (> 10 minutes).</p>
<br>

<h2><u>Possible Limitation of This Project</u></h2>
<p>Since the data was collected through the observation of the broadcast screen, the data may not be 100% correct.</p>
<small>Ex)</small>
<br>
<small> - As the data recording was made based on observation, when the ball was touched on the border of the grids of the field, the area number that was recorded may not be exactly the same as the actual touched area.</small>
<br>
<small> - As the data recording was made based on the broadcast screen, some touches that were not shown due to replays could not be recorded, indicating that the total number of touches on the field may not be 100% accurate.</small>
